This is a game for building your memory!  It is also a demonstration of how *easy* it is to build for urbit without using a single atom, noun, arm, rune, or halberd.  Okay, I made the last one up.  This project is powered by dcSpark's Urbit Visor tool.  Check out their docs.  It's absurdly easy to use it as middleware to serve content to urbit address space owners in general, or specific @p's.  Easy enough that I can do it.
